- 👋 Hi, I’m @orangesrs
- 👀 I’m interested in learning about the world & how we can improve it through econometrics! 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about data privacy, evaluating predictive algorithms' fairness, Bayesian statistics and very basic ML in classes. I'm also always working on my R and Python
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything data science, since I'm still pretty new
- 📫 How to reach me: My email is sarah.jiang02@gmail.com, plus sjian056@ucr.edu as long as UCR ITS doesn't delete it
- 😄 Pronouns: they
- ⚡ Fun fact: I started college in public policy, took a soft left into economics, and then a harder one towards data science.
